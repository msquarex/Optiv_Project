It is the responsibility of users and their managers to inform the (IT Service Desk] in a timely
manner when employees leave the organisation and so no longer need access to IT systems.
As much advance notice as possible should be given. In those circumstances where an
employee has been involuntarily terminated at short notice, the [IT Service Desk] must be
informed by telephone immediately.

number of people with such rights should be carefully controlled, and rights should be
removed as soon as they are no longer required.
